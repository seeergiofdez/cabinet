Kio Beats is available now to stream! It's a station composed of indie pop / rock music and similar different genres. Containing songs from 2010s. It's hosted directly by The Bureau new iteration.

It's gonna be initially streamed on places like Nightclub Los Trastos, or Bar Las Dehesas.

With the motto "Let the game begin. Which one of these songs will you hate the most?", this could remember to Moore's playlist. It's actually based on it.

<b>History</b>
Kio Beats was made using some of already existing radios, like <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4B46f2a757VHVp6aRoNtzE">The Labs X FM</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5meU521T9zQMfxmqXSsPm0">Independence Pop FM</a>. Then, we've added some more indie taste with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6undnlVhPbAU5o6PL2fhwc">Radio Mirror Park</a>, the radio from GTA V. Then, we finally adjusted with Dyne's playlist <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nzwuBKD35j2O8wh0W3Rb8">Moore's Place</a>, which contains pop and modern indie tracks.
