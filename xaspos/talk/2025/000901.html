To our dedicated team, valued clients, and partners,

I am writing today with a deep sense of responsibility as I assume the role as CEO of BBJProjeK, effective today, <b>September 1st, 2025</b>.

I want to begin by acknowledging my predecessor, Damian Brey. I extend my thanks to him for his leadership. His knowledge provided a truly unique perspective on the challenges we face, and for that learning experience, we are certainly wiser. The past has given us a very clear picture of what to and not to do, and for that clarity, I must express gratitude for his hard work.

Being unequivocally clear about the future, mission here is to reignite the innovative spark that founded BBJProjeK. We will move forward with purpose, not just to correct course, but to build something stronger and more resilient than before.

This all mean that we are empowering our people and restoring a culture of collaboration, respect, and bold creativity, re-earning the trust through unwavering quality, transparent communication, and impeccable service, and focusing relentlessly on execution and delivering on the promises we make to each other and to you.

And so it is with great pride, but with greater humility that I, Dyne Larsen, officially announce my new role as CEO. And if you give me your vote and have faith in me I promise you won't be sick and tired anymore.

Letâ€™s get to work.

Sincerely,

Dyne Larsen
Chief Executive Officer
BBJProjeK
