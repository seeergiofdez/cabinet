Remember that BBJProjeK will take a fine-tuning to its content delivery network (CDN) during July and August. This update will include even faster uploads and downloads, new upload customizations, and more powerful DDoS mitigation. Known as the <b>07/2025 release</b>.

Main CDN update will take place on July 23rd, 2025, and will disrupt the service for a few hours.

<b class="a1">More upload customization</b>
On October 2023 we introduced some new features such as a timebomb (formerly known as "expiry time"), in which you could set the time where the files are valid and available to download or view (5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour, 24 hour, or 7 days).

Learn more about the 10/2023 CDN update here: <a target="_blank" href="http://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/xaspos/talk/2023/019009.html">[Ticket] Internal Changes in CDN Backend.</a>

With this new 07/2025 release, you can not only set a custom expiry date or timebomb, but also enable a one-time file download, in which the file will auto-destroy once it's been accessed. Also, the option to upload larger files has been enabled for all registered users, with a limit of 8GB (8192MB) per file.

Before uploading a file, you can now choose the visibility of the file (public, organization-only or private).

<b class="a1">Annual cleanup</b>
Every summer we also take a general cleanup of CDN files. Regular files and sessions will be deleted. This ensures that no unnecessary data is retained, and also help us to comply with data protection regulations, and <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#37-2025">37/2025 RaBBAu Internal Note</a>.

If before July 31st you detect that there are files uploaded to cdn that should not be automatically deleted for a justified cause, such as a pending claim, legal requirements, or files of special importance, you can ask the the DAWG to mark it for not deleting. They will be able to do so by following a few simple steps.

With the deletion of sessions and files, some synchronizations with mail, gitlab, and other media library will also be deleted. This will involve the deletion of contact groups in mail, sharing files to the public and any authorizations granted to team members for usage or download.

Remember that there are some exceptions, in which files will never be deleted on annual cleanups, this includes:
* Files uploaded by an admin account.
* Files uploaded flagged for general use (public resources).
* Files with special importance (important flag).
* Files that has been reported by legal requirements.

<b class="a1">Remember... why using BBJProjeK CDN?</b>
* It's one of the fastest and cleanest content delivery network.
* It includes customization options such as one-time file viewing, timebombs, and user restrictions.
* It's a secure, sovereign and sustainable platform.
* Doesn't generate digital footprint and doesn't save user data.
* Uses open source code and libraries..
* Uses own-hosted hardware in different Europe countries.
* It's energy-efficient and is powered by 100% renewable energy.
