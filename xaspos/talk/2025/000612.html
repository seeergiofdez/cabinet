Dear Team

We would like to inform you that BBJProjek will temporarily suspend operations for 72 hours, starting from Monday, June 23th, 2025, due to unforeseen technical networking issues.
We detected several violations of our internal policy by several members of the organization, which put in risk the infrastructure and values of our organization.

Our IT team, alongside Ragyxo team is actively working to resolve these challenges to ensure minimal disruption. During this period, access to company systems, emails, and project platforms may be limited.

<b>Details:</b>
* Duration: 72 hours (from Monday, June 23th, 2025 (00:00) to Wednesday, June 25th, 2025 (23:59))
* Reason: Violation of policies, critical network infrastructure issue resolution
* Impact: Delayed responses, downtime in services

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience. Regular updates will be provided via [Email/Company Portal/Alternative Channel].

For urgent matters, please contact Damian Brey at <a href="mailto:dbrey@bbjprojek.org">dbrey@bbjprojek.org</a>.
