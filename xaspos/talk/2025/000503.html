<b>This is the final notice</b>: The use of FlaTOR testing is strictly prohibited effective immediately. Despite its prior deprecation on May 18th, 2025, some teams have continued to employ FlaTOR, its submodules, and associated procedures (FAT/SAT).

<b>Why is this being enforced now?</b>
- FlaTOR no longer aligns with organizational standards.
- Its misuse has led to procedural inefficiencies and unjustified failures.
- Continued reliance on FlaTOR undermines the deprecation directive issued earlier.

<b>Consequences of Non-Compliance:</b>
Any further use of FlaTOR will be treated as a violation of internal protocols. Teams found using it will face corrective actions.

<b>What’s next?</b>
No replacement for FlaTOR is planned. All testing must adhere to current approved methodologies.

For historical reference, consult the 23-2025 RaBBAu Internal Note (Ragyxo team access required). This ticket serves as the absolute final warning—FlaTOR is now deprecated and banned
