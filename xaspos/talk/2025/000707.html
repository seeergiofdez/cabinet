Within the organization, there are several ways of communicating, announcing and sending information, and each way has different purposes and formalities.

<b class="a1">Where to post?</b>
You can communicate with other members using your Slack account, sending emails, publishing into XasPos, or making announcements on the wiki blog. Which one to choose?

<b>Slack</b>
Each member has a unique Slack account in which you can communicate with other members, create, manage and participate in assigned groups and channels, and do teamwork. This is the most informal way of communicating, but the most used and convenient tool.

Learn more about using Slack on our dedicated wiki page in <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/services/slack/">https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/services/slack/</a>.

<b>Email</b>
As well as with Slack, each user has an email address in which you can read and send mails to any address (not limited to bbjprojek.org accounts).

Generally, email is best for formal and detailed communication, and/or when a record of the communication is needed. Texting is more appropriate for quick, informal messages, especially when a prompt response is needed. 

<b>XasPos</b>
We can define Xaspos as a board of announcements, changes and other information that is accessible by everyone, not limited to bbjprojek members. It’s available at cabinet.bbjprojek.org/xaspos

You would want to create a xaspos tickets for internal or external non-critical announcements that worth to be notified to the organization, such as a product improvement, product release or update, or, new project, or problem within the organization.

Remember that on Xaspos, you can choose the visibility of the ticket to public, internal, or to selected members. You might want to use public when there is a general product release, and choose internal when  only bbjprojek members are interested in a specific product or project, such as gitlab CD/CI pipelines.

<b>Blog post</b>
Blog posts are generally used only for major product releases and improvements, critical information that may affect external people, general guidelines, and other information that is of big importance and interest. You might communicate through email or Slack whether the post you want to upload is suitable for the BBJProjeK Blog.

<b class="a1">So... when to post?</b>
Generally, there is no “right time” on when to post or send a message. On Slack or email, you generally just send a message whenever you feel like it. On XasPos, you might want to create an announcement before or just in time a product is released. If it’s a service disruption or a product improvement, you might want to notify before the disruption date comes.
