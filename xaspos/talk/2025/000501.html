  <pre>

Starting on May 18th, 2025 (May 17th), we are deprecating BBJProjeK FlaTOR, all its submodules (including enforcing mode), as well as FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) and SAT ( Site Acceptance Test) procedures.

<b>Why are we deprecating?</b>
It is stated, on the internal documentation, that is not benefiting the organization to include FlaTOR on the whole service.
Also, FAT procedures is being executed as an excuse for other manners, as well as an excuse to fail on FlaTOR.

<b>What's next?</b>
We're not planning including any another similar procedure for now.

This is a ticket for the record, if you want to read about this deprecation, ask Ragyxo team access for the <u>23-2025 RaBBAu Internal Note</u>.
