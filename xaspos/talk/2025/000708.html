BBJProjeK The Bureau iteration (<a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#22-2025" target="_blank">22/2025 RaBBAu Note</a>) was created since The Authority iteration was paused by the Ragyxo Foundation due to ongoing legal matters involving the team.

The Bureau was created silently for maintaining the works made under The Authority. But today, <b>The Authority iteration</b> can operate as it used to do, meaning The Bureau iterations and its member joins back The Authority, maintaining and creating new projects.

Ragyxo approved this on <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#39-2025" target="_blank">39/2025 RaBBAu Note</a> on July 13th, 2025.

Ticket for the record.
All notes that refer to "The Bureau" between January 2025 and July 2025 is actually "The Authority".
