RaBBAu Contest 25, part of the RaBBAu Contests, is back again.

Two years ago was known as the BBJProjeK Contests. But in this new exciting competition, creators, developers, and innovators come together one more year to showcase their finest open-source projects. It's not just about submitting code-it's about innovation, creativity, and pushing boundaries in the tech space. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer with a fresh perspective, this contest is designed to bring out the best in you.

Winners of RaBBAu Contest 25 will not only gain bragging rights in the open-source community but also take home cash prizes, exclusive mentorship opportunities, and get their work featured across the BBJProjeK network.

If you're interested in joining or get more information about this contest, follow the link below. Full guidelines and deadlines are available now.
