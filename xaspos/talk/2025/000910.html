This ticket serves as an policy governing the systematic preservation of our public-facing web content. This is actually a summary of <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#58-2025">58/2025 Internal RaBBAu Note</a>, which will be updated at the search soon.

For the organization, is of critical importance maintaining a permanent public record of our digital communications, publications, and historical information. So this policy establishes procedure for archiving designated webpages with the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

Archiving allows transparency and accountability, historical <b>preservation of projects and sites</b>. Not only to ensure the long-term availability of significant announcements, press releases, annual reports, and other materials of enduring value, but also to create a <b>verifiable external archive</b> that can serve as evidence of content publication dates, <b>supporting legal</b>, regulatory, or audit requirements.

<a class="a1">Designated Webpages for Regular Archiving</a>
The following categories of webpages have been identified as high-priority for regular and systematic archiving. Department heads are responsible for ensuring the URLs within their purview are added to the archiving schedule.

* Corporate & legal
* Publications & Research
* Product & Service Information

<a class="a1">Archiving Frequency</a>
The archiving frequency shall be determined by the volatility and significance of the content:

* Static Policy Pages (e.g., Terms of Service, Privacy Policy): Archived immediately following any update or amendment.
* Dynamic Content (e.g., Press Releases, Blog): Archived upon publication and again with each significant update.
* Reference Pages (e.g., Annual Reports, Leadership Bios): Archived on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, or as changes occur.


<a class="a1">Responsibilities & Ver.</a>
