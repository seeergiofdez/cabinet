Hi!
Just a quick reminder that the organization is now offering email addresses under the rabbau.com domain.

This service is available to all members of the organization. The rabbau.com domain utilizes the same core infrastructure as our primary bbjprojek.org system, ensuring that all features and reliability are consistent across both domains.

Be aware that these addresses are designated for <b>personal and recreational use</b> by organization members. They are not to be considered formal work emails for official organizational business.

If you're interested in this, reach the team at <i>#mail</i> channel at Slack, or send us an email. We accept custom usernames, so just tell us which username you want. The first wave of this opt-in service is available until this Sunday, <b>October 12th, 2025</b>.

We've just added a page about custom and personal addresses on our handbook. Read it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/services/mail/personaladdress/">Personal Addresses</a>.
