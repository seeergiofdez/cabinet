Following the Ragyxo protocols, <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#30-2025">30/2025 RaBBAu Note</a> defines the legal limits between the prohibitions that Swift Lynx can exercise towards the organization, while limiting the power that this tool can have towards users of the organization or third parties.

While note <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#29-2025">30/2025 RaBBAu Note</a> legally defines the new Swift Lynx entity, 30/2025 sets limits to it so that the tool does not pose an ethical or privacy risk to the organization.

Ethical safeguards will ensure that there are no conflicts of interest between Swift Lynx and BBJProjeK.

<b>Why this matters</b>
Going back a few months, the <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#16-2025">16/2025 RaBBAu Note</a> marked a change in the way Ragyxo controls the BBJProjeK's shares.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#30-2025">30/2025 RaBBAu Note</a> is therefore necessary due to possible future moral and security excuses that could be generated to modify the organization's behavior, based on third-party interests.

This note, drafted in conjunction with the DAWG and OPWG teams, ensures a good relationship between the new security system and the organization.

<b>It happened before</b>
This note had to be redacted because of what happened with FlaTOR last days. A legal excuse was made to recover, reverse engineer, and rebuild FlaTOR nightly release. With this note we ensure this won't happen again. These acts have already been sanctioned and appropriate measures have been taken.

30/2025 goes effective on June 18th, 2025 at 00:00GMT, and documentation is available for anyone to read. Discussion about Swift Lynx Security is taking place on Slack, <b>#iterations</b> channel.
