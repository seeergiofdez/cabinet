As of 13th June 2025, and governed by <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#27-2025">27/2025 RaBBAu Note</a>, FlaTOR is now officially dissolved, and so used resources has been reassigned for other purposes. These includes resources for a faster CND and mail infrastructure.

Beginning with <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#23-2025">23/2025 RaBBAu Note</a> (May 18th, 2025), BBJProjeK FlaTOR was deprecated, including all its submodules, as well as FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) and SAT ( Site Acceptance Test) procedures.

This announcement formalizes the reallocation of FlaTOR-associated resources to align with organizational priorities.

<b>Scope of Reassignment</b>
Teams formerly supporting FlaTOR (development, compliance, documentation) will transition to high-priority projects under Ragyxo oversight.
Dynamic parameters and thresholds defined in <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#13-2025">13/2025 RaBBAu Note</a> are nullified; systems must adopt current standards

<b>Documentation</b>
All FlaTOR-related guides (including A-2025-11 Extended Documentation) are archived. Access requires Ragyxo approval.
<a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#52-2024">52/2024</a> and <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#7-2025">7/2025</a> notes remain repealed; <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#11-2025">11/2025</a> and <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#13-2025">13/2025</a> are obsolete for operational purposes.

---

Thanks for being part of FlaTOR. It's been a good time. But new tools, better workflows, and smarter testing approaches are on the horizon. Let’s take what we’ve learned and build something even stronger.
Questions? Hit up Ragyxo or check the archives if you’re feeling nostalgic. Otherwise, onward and upward!
