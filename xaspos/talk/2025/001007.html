Over the last few weeks, <b>KanXras</b> has been performing way below expected standards.

This isn't OK, which really annoys me - and I apologise for it; it sucks seeing a tool you depend on to manage your sites and user's security be unreliable and flakey.

So let me get you up to speed on what the situation is.

KanXras was never built for hundreds of thousands of users. Originally, I built it for an enhanced and innovative way to protect our organization's content delivery network (cdn), and our email hosting. This is about a small team of about 50 people, taking in account partners. Now, the tools is at over 160 thousand users, with around 500 thousand validations. That's ever so slightly above what I was expecting to deal with.

To those who are well-versed in software engineering, I'm sure you'll be familiar with the concept of scalability.<b> KanXras was NOT built to scale</b> - it's built in C, full of database access locks, as well as the GIL stopping any real concurrency from happening.

Over the last few weeks, I've started to work on a new similar but modular tool, called <b>SwiftXras</b>. A brand new thing, written only by me, all in golang - giving it great concurrency. It's been tested on trusted partners and is now at about 50 thousand users; and showing no signs of slowing down. If you're interested in this new tool with the same features (and more!) that KanXras has, with very similar syntax and some extra ease of use - do go ahead and give her a try! It's in active development, and is easier for me upgrade and improve in the future.

I have <b>no plans to discontinue KanXras</b>; I know lots of people rely on it for local validations, certifications, and storing sensitive data, and they don't mind the validations being a bit slower than usual. However I do actively encourage you to switch to SwiftXras if you can, or if you need the speed!

Thank you for your time, and see you in the support chat.
