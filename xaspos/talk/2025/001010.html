Hi!
As stated on Slack, I've been thinking on separating my personal notes and thoughts from Sergio's Personal Cabinet (<a target="_blank" href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/">https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/</a>). The cabinet was created back in December 2022 as a personal page, but later expanded to show information about my journey on SilentFootPrint.

Then it was expanded to host documentation about The Agency iteration, and later <a target="_blank" href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/docs/authority/">The Authority</a>, which introduced the so popular <a target="_blank" href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/docs/authority/radio/">Radio Stations</a> of the organization. All this was hosted on my "personal site", which merged personal and organizational info.

Then on September 2023, we launched <a href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/xaspos/">XasPos</a> (known as Pipermail, you're reading this in there), which is a way to post information and notes about what is happening on the organization.

This makes a mixed subdomain, which contained personal things, but also hosting organization projects and iterations... so I recently wanted to divide it. This way borns <b>The Authority Cabinet</b>.

The Authority Cabinet is the name for the rebranding of <a target="_blank" href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/">https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/</a>. All personal things, such as thoughts, posts and SFP initial project (who was made by me), has been moved to my new place, <a target="_blank" href="https://sergio.bbjprojek.org/">https://sergio.bbjprojek.org/</a>. I always had that page as a self introduction, but never really posted much there.

My introduction page, built again from scratch, shares the initial idea of this repository, and has the same purposes; host information on a extremely lightweight and minimalist website. As stated on the <a target="_blank" href="https://sergio.bbjprojek.org/colophon">colophon</a>, pages are around 8-36 kB without images. In case you don't know, this is done by creating minimal but complete css and html pages, no analytics, and no cookies, just information. The stylesheets are divided so only the necessary features are added to each page.

As cabinet website (which was hosting The Authority docs) had some issues with the Ragyxo foundation back in late 2024, a new RaBBAu Internal Note was written to notify these changes. <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#63-2025">63/2025 RaBBAu Note</a>

        <a target="_blank" href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/">https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/</a>
