I've decided to discontinue the PIF project.

Google is increasingly putting up more obstacles, and I no longer have as much time to dedicate to this as I used to. It's been a very interesting journey, and I've learned a lot. I thank everyone who has accompanied me and contributed to the project.

But things seem to be getting worse, and Google is going to make it even harder to use its services (GMS) on devices with an unlocked bootloader.

As an alternative, you can use, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork">PlayIntegrityFork</a>
