Today we’re announcing the launch of <b>KanXras</b>, our revolutionary two-step verification (2SV) peak method—designed to keep accounts even safer.

KanXras combines and may use biometric data recognition, IP verifications, and behavioral analysis to ensure that is only you who is trying to access the account. No more unauthorized logins—just seamless, ironclad protection.

<b>How it works</b>
It employs a multi-layered authentication framework to verify user identity with precision. At its core, the system integrates biometric validation—leveraging device-native sensors (such as fingerprint scanners or facial recognition modules) to match stored user biometric templates in real time.

Simultaneously, KanXras performs IP reputation analysis, cross-referencing login attempts against a whitelist of recognized networks and hardware signatures. Suspicious deviations—such as unrecognized geolocations or anomalous device configurations—trigger secondary challenges or temporary access restrictions.

To further mitigate session hijacking and brute-force attacks, the system implements adaptive behavioral heuristics, monitoring patterns like keystroke dynamics, navigation tempo, and typical activity windows. These metrics are continuously updated, allowing KanXras to dynamically adjust authentication strictness based on risk assessment.

<b>Activation</b>
KanXras will be available to all verified users in the coming hours. <u>(Official launch date: 24th June 2025).</u>

KanXras is included as an <u>optional security feature</u> which will be available to enable under BBJProjeK Mail settings, under security tab (<a target="_blank" href="https://mail.bbjprojek.org/">https://mail.bbjprojek.org/</a>).

Enabling this security option, you agree with optional privacy policy, which is especified under 33/2025 RaBBau Note, available to all users. Link below.
