Hi.
Today, under <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#29-2025">29/2025 RaBBAu Note</a>, we're releasing Swift Lynx Security, a cybersecurity and threat intelligence platform co-developed and maintained by The Authority iteration and The Ragyxo Foundation.

It specializes in preemptive digital defense, covert surveillance, and offensive countermeasures.

<b>Acquiring a Swift Lynx license</b>
Member must complete the New Model Certification by 30th July 2025 (training modules SLX-TN/2026-09A) for getting access to the advanced tools of Swift Lynx Security. A valid bbjprojek or ragyxo account is still needed for authentication.

<b>Features</b>
Swift Lynx features digital footprint analysis & erasure tools, privacy switches and privacy-focused communication tools, also known as <b>LynxChat</b>.
Learn more about its features at the BBJProjeK handbook: <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/services/swiftlynx/">Swift Lynx Security</a>.


I'm also communicating that I, Ruben Bautista, am now a member of the Operations Working Group of BBJProjeK. I come with several years of experience in software security infrastructure optimization and data protection. I am eager to contribute to our shared objectives and to collaborate with the whole org!

Thank you
Ruben Bautista
