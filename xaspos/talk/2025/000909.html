Hi,
Today we announce the recreation of RaBBAu, now called <b>RaBBAu Next</b>.

<img width="100px" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/bbjprojek/rane.png">

It is the new iteration from the BBJProjeK organization for recreative and personal projects. It also serves as a domain address for personal use (<a target="_blank" href="rabbau.com">rabbau.com</a>).

<a class="a1">Some History</a>
The name “RaBBAu” has a layered history, as it was originally established as a legal bridge between the BBJProjeK organization and the Ragyxo foundation, created by Damian Brey to establish cooperation between both parties.

The most notable project from this period was the RaBBAu Internal Notes, a system still used to define and set guidelines for different projects and changes within the organization.

It is important to distinguish this entity from Rabbau city. Although the city was previously stylized as “RaBBAu,” the capitalization was later standardized to “Rabbau” to avoid confusion with the Internal Notes system. This official name change is defined in the 40/2025 RaBBAu Internal Note.

--

The current iteration, <b>RaBBAu Next</b>, is being specified in the <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#54-2025">54/2025 RaBBAu Internal Note</a>, which will be available in the next hours. This new entity operates as part of the BBJProjeK Organization, same as with the well known; <b>The Authority</b>.

A page in bbjprojek.org is being redacted and will be available soon.

<a class="a1">Domains</a>
On the Operational Meeting No. 8, we discussed about new domains.

Two domains were bought for this iteration; <a target="_blank" href="https://rabbau.com">https://rabbau.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://rabb.au/">https://rabb.au/</a>. The last one used only as an internal URL shortener for links inside the trusted domains (see the list on the <a target="_blank" href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes#55-2025">55/2025 RaBBAu Internal Note</a>).

<a class="a1">Email Addresses</a>
This note serves as an official announcement that the organization is now <b>offering email addresses under the rabbau.com</b> domain.

This service is available to all members of the organization. The rabbau.com domain utilizes the same core infrastructure as our primary bbjprojek.org system, ensuring that all features and reliability are consistent across both domains.

<b>Note</b>: Please be aware that *@rabbau.com addresses are designated for <b>personal and recreational use</b> by organization members. They are not to be considered formal work emails for official organizational business.

<b>Opting-In</b>: This offer is available as an opt-in service until October 12th, 2025. Requests submitted after this date may not be accommodated.
