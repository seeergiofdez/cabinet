Few days ago, Ragyxo communicated to us the 7/2025 RaBBAu Internal Note. While we appreciate the notification, we would like to clarify that this note, despite being labeled as "internal," has external implications as it directly affects our operations. As per our standard practice, any communication that impacts our work is documented and made accessible within our research repository for transparency and reference (see link below).

However, the issue at hand is that the new note does not provide clear guidance or actionable steps for compliance. The document outlines certain expectations but fails to specify how Ragyxo intends for us to address or implement these requirements. This lack of clarity makes it challenging for us to determine the appropriate course of action.

Until we receive more information, we are unable to proceed with compliance in a meaningful or effective manner. We value our partnership with Ragyxo and are committed to adhering to all relevant regulations and guidelines. However, we believe that compliance must be based on clear, actionable directives to ensure mutual understanding and alignment.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
Dyne Larsen
