<a class="a1">Agenda</a>
<b>1. Hello to the new integrants</b>
* Introducing theirselves.

<b>2. Discussing about recently joined members to the organization and new assigned roles</b>

<b>3. Slack #partners channel</b>
* We are moving #partners to #associates
<i>"#partners was created by Damian Brey", I don't want anything that remind me of him"</i>

<b>4. Not exactly anything</b>
Tillie apparently programs better when he's drunk. Giulia's already messing around with Typst (we hate Rust). They're going to introduce LaTeX to the first year studnets. Freddy switches to Ubunt and they're going to change the entire standard to Rust.

<b>5. RaBBAu as rabbau.com</b>
* RaBBAu Next borns today. The new iteration of RaBBAu.
* Peeno and Freddy get confused.
* As of today (2025-09-22), new two domains have been bought. <a target="_blank" href="https://rabbau.com">https://rabbau.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://rabb.au">https://rabb.au</a>. The later one not yet just set up, but it's gonna be intended as a url shortener (just like goo.gl).
* RaBBAu description has to be made yet, which will be available at <a target="_blank" href="https://bbjprojek.org/rabbau/">https://bbjprojek.org/rabbau/</a>. A thing yet to do.
* Some Google Workspace accounts are being migrated from <b>bbjprojek.org</b> to <b>rabbau.com</b> for users who use email for personal use.

<b>6. RaBBAu as the iteration</b>
* RaBBAu (the legacy one), is being reassambled, and RaBBAu Notes are being simplified. A future RaBBAu Internal Note is being redacted now which updates the legal agreement between the organization and the foundation, as well as the own purpose of the RaBBau Network.

<b>7. The Locc Designers</b>
* Members of the designer team and Sergio were preparing new adverts for BBJProjeK 25H2, which was introduced two days ago (2025-09-22), and the logo for RaBBau Next was been discussed.
* Votes for RaBBAu Next logo started. Option C gets accepted for now, as it is temporary.

<b>8. Future plans</b>
* Cleaning up the Ragyxo foundation connections
* Mail improvements
* Swift Lynx and KanXras security updates (by Tillie).
* Income statement
* "BBJProjeK in Numbers" for 2025.
