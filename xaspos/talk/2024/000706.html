Recently, the different current working groups have been restructured and modified for current and future organization needs.

The following teams has been modified.

<b>Data Working Group</b>
Info on: <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/team/data-working-group/">https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/team/data-working-group/</a>

Is a staff team authorized by the organization to deal with accusations of copyright infringement, imports, serious disputes and vandalism.

<b>Operations Working Group</b>
Info on: <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/team/operations-working-group/">https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/team/operations-working-group</a>

Is responsible for proposing the budget for, and running of the servers owned by The BBJProjeK Organization.

The key priority for this team is ensuring the operation and smooth running of the different servers and data distribution services

---

Now, two new groups have been created to deal with external organizations and companies, as well as planning and governing new ideas, projects and future issues around our own organization:

<b>Strategic and Planning Working Group</b>
Responsible for developing and refining the long-term strategies and goals of the organization. This group analyzes market trends, competitive landscapes, and internal capabilities to create a roadmap that guides the organization's growth and development

<b>Oversight Working Group</b>
Responsible for providing governance, oversight, and strategic direction to the organization. This group ensures that the organization operates in accordance with its mission, vision, and values while maintaining accountability to stakeholders.

A detailed information about these new working groups is available on The BBJProjeK Handbook, link below.

Have a nice weekend
