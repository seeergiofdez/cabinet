Rewatch UEFA Euro 2024 Spain vs England
<i>"Spain's victory caps off perfect campaign"</i>

La Roja won all seven games without needing penalties, a record at a European Championship. A 2-1 win over England in the final made them European champions for an unprecedented fourth time.

And they did it the hard way, beating every other European nation who have ever won a World Cup - Italy, Germany, France and England, plus beaten 2018 finalists Croatia - on the way to glory in Berlin.

In Rodri they had the player of the tournament. In teenage sensation Lamine Yamal they had the young player of the tournament. Dani Olmo shared the Golden Boot. Yamal had the most assists.

It is easy to forget they did not come into the tournament as one of the absolute favourites, with England and France the two tipped for glory.

Even England boss Gareth Southgate admitted Spain were deserved champions.

<h2>De la Fuente deserves much credit</h2>
This is the peak of Luis de la Fuente's career for sure. The 63-year-old has been Spain's senior manager since 2022, having previously managed several of the current first team with the under-19s, U21s and U23s.

This is his third European Championship win with his nation - having won with the U19s and U21s, and now the senior team.

In that successful U19s team in 2015 were Rodri, who was named the best player of Euro 2024, Mikel Merino, who scored the winner against Germany in the quarter-finals, and first-choice keeper Unai Simon.

De la Fuente has never managed in La Liga and was sacked from his last club job, Alaves, after just four months in 2011.

"De la Fuente knew most of these players from the academies and they are growing as a team," said Mata.
"He deserves all the credit - him, his assistants and the players."

Balague added: "He is a manager who doesn't want the attention and has taken the national football level to a new height.
"Spain have beaten everyone put in front of them - that is not easy to do."
