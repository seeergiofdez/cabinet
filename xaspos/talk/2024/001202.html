Hi,
After some may know, The Ragyxo Foundation has been supporting us for quite some time now, and since the introduction of the RaBBAu Directives, (RaBBAu Internal Notes) our way of working has changed.

These notes / directives cover many crucial operational aspects, such as legal advises, infrastructure updates, legal compliance standards, and operational guidelines. They are crucial because it guarantees the correct operation of our organization.

The main problem with <b>RaBBAu Internal Notes</b> is that, as the name states, they are <b>internal</b>. It means that we only have access to those notes or directives that directly affect us in some way. There are many other notes that remain unknown to us, and this is a problem. This is already explained <a href="https://get.cdn.bbjprojek.org/download_private_full?token=c33WLYDJ4gp0yZ6a6uZGov5gr1FtAB9rQv2N">here</a>, and on the <a href="https://get.cdn.bbjprojek.org/download_private_full?token=TCtKGHC3JGr19TA8bd4y5FBlDfEteOa8WHdz">[DOCX] RaBBAu Notes Conflicts</a> document.

Currently, BBJProjeK members that work with Ragyxo has opened a webpage on their domain called <a href="https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes">RaBBAu Internal Notes Research</a>. This is, in other words, a research of those notes that have been notified to BBJProjeK, other partners, or that have been pulled out from public documents, git histories or other sources. Only some details about the note are shared, and rarely the whole document is published.

We invite all eligible members to cast their vote on the <b>proposal to make the currently private RaBBAu Notes publicly available</b>. Your vote is crucial in shaping the future of our organization's transparency and collaboration. By participating in this decision, you are directly influencing how information is shared and used, ensuring alignment with our collective values and operational needs.

Whether you believe public access to these notes will foster better cooperation or prefer to maintain the current level of confidentiality, your input matters. Cast your vote and be a part of this pivotal moment for BBJProjeK and its partners.

<b><a href="https://playground.bbjprojek.org/proposal/83">Vote now!</a></b>

Thank you,
Damian Brey, BBJProjeK CEO
