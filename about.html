  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>The Authority (formerly Sergio's Personal Cabinet) is a website which hosts some documentation and projects made by a small group of the organization. Formerly, it was Sergio's personal site, which has moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://sergio.bbjprojek.org/">https://sergio.bbjprojek.org/</a>. Here you will find some documentation about SilentFootPrint, and other iterations, such as <a href="docs/authority">The Authority<a> or <a href="docs/agency">The Agency</a>. This domain is also currently hosting <a target="_blank" href="/xaspos">XasPos↗</a>.</p>

  <h2>Website</h2>
  <p>This website is built from scratch, all the HTML and CSS is manually written, and the whole repository is publicly available at <a target="_blank" href="https://git.bbjprojek.org/cabinet">bbjprojek/cabinet↗</a>.</p>
  <p>This website is intended to use really lightweight resources (with pages around 12-52 kB without images). There are several stylesheets and scripts so this way only the necessary features are provided for each HTML page. The main stylesheets information can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="https://git.bbjprojek.org/cabinet/-/blob/master/README.md">README↗</a> file of the repository.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
  <p>This page <b>does not store cookies</b>. If you find one, it’s probably a bug, and we’d appreciate if you’d let us know.</p>
  <p>To show some iframes and external info, a button is used to prevent non-consensual tracking as far as possible, these iframes are “hidden” behind the button. Note that we use non-tracking embed codes, yet they may still track you; this is beyond our control. This also saves a lot of bandwith, since the third-party iframes pull in a lot of JavaScript.</p>
  <p>No analytics are recorded. This page is hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://git.bbjprojek.org/cabinet/-/pipelines">GitLab Pages</a>. Also, this page is designed to last. Almost every principle that Jeff Huang specifies in their post is followed: <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/" target="_blank">This Page is Designed to Last↗</a>. Vanilla HTML/CSS is used, as few pages as possible are written to retain information, native fonts, and trying no hotlink.</p>
