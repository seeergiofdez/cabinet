  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Sergio's Personal Cabinet is a personal blog / website. Here you will find some personal projects and documentation, as well as other non-personal docs, such as <a href="docs/authority">The Authority<a> or <a href="docs/agency">The Agency</a>.</p>

  <h2>Website</h2>
  <p>This website is built from scratch, all the HTML and CSS is manually written by me, and is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://git.bbjprojek.org/cabinet">https://git.bbjprojek.org/cabinet↗</a>. That's probably why the overall design is not the best. However, I kinda like it and I find it unique. I'm not interested on moving to any static website generator or something similar, for now.</p>
  <p>In my desire to make a really lightweight but modern html5 website (with pages around 12-60 kB without images), I had to divide stylesheets and scripts so this way I only add the necessary features for each HTML page.</p>
  <p>The main stylesheets information can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="https://git.bbjprojek.org/cabinet/-/blob/Strontium/README.md">README↗</a> file of the repository.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>This page <b>does not store cookies</b>. If you find one, it’s probably a bug, and I’d appreciate if you’d let me know.</p>
  <p>To show some iframes and external info, I use a button to prevent non-consensual tracking as far as possible, these iframes are “hidden” behind the button. Note that I’ve used the non-tracking embed codes, yet they may still track you; this is beyond my control. This also saves a lot of bandwith, since the third-party iframes pull in a lot of JavaScript.</p>
  <p>I don’t use any kind of analytics. This page is hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://git.bbjprojek.org/cabinet/-/pipelines">GitLab Pages</a> and I try not to hotlinl, but I use <a target="_blank" href="https://telegra.ph">Telegraph</a> to host some images externally.</p>
  <p>This page is designed to last. This site uses almost every principles that Jeff Huang specifies in their post: <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/" target="_blank">This Page is Designed to Last↗</a>. I use vanilla HTML/CSS, I don't minimize HTML, I use as few pages as possible to retain information, I don't hotlink... and I do use native fonts.</p>
