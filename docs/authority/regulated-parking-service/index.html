  <h1>Regulated Parking Service (SER). Schedule, delimitation and differentiated areas.</h1>
  <p>The purpose of the Regulated Parking Service (SER), formerly called "ORA", is the management, regulation and control of vehicle parking in certain areas of public roads in the map, with the aim of rationalizing and making compatible the use of public space and vehicle parking.</p>


  <h2 id="schedule">Schedule of SER</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Monday to Friday</b>: from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.</li>
    <li><b>Saturdays</b>: from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</li>
    <li><b>Month of August (Monday to Saturday, not holidays)</b>: from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</li>
    <li><b>On December 24 and 31</b>: from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</li>
    <li><b>Sundays and holidays</b>: No service.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The territorial scope, called Regulated Parking Service Area (SER Area), is subdivided into neighborhoods. You can check if an address is within the regulated area.</p>

  <h2 id="spaces">Spaces and Differentiated Areas of the Regulated Parking Service</h2>
  <p>There are different types of places, <b>green</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>mixed</b> and <b>high turnover</b>, as well as two Differentiated Areas, for deterrent use and for use for socio-sanitary reasons. Consult the associated documentation for the plans with the delimitation of the different typologies. and areas. You can also consult the open data set “SER Regulated Parking Service Zones”</p>

  <h3>Green Spaces</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Users with resident authorization can park without a time limit within their neighborhood. On the boundary between one neighborhood and another, you can park in the green spaces on both sidewalks.</li>
    <li>The rest of the users can park for a maximum of two hours. Once this maximum has been reached, you cannot park again in the same neighborhood until one hour has passed since the parking end time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Blue Spaces</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Any user can park for a maximum of four hours. On the delimiting roads between neighborhoods, you can park on both sidewalks as long as you have paid the amount corresponding to the color of the space. Once this maximum has been reached, you cannot park again in the same neighborhood until one hour has passed since the parking end time.</li>
    <li>Users with resident authorization can park from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. within their neighborhood. On the boundary between one neighborhood and another, you can park in the blue spaces on both sidewalks during that time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>High Turnover Spaces</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Any user can park as long as the vehicle has an environmental label, after paying the fee corresponding to high turnover spaces and without prejudice to the exclusions to the limitation of the parking duration and payment of the fee. The fact of being the holder of a SER resident or commercial vehicle authorization does not exempt you from payment. The squares are marked horizontally by rectangles of twenty by thirty centimeters of alternating blue and white colors, and on the delimited area, by zig zag polygonal lines alternating blue and white colors. High turnover plazas are also marked with vertical signage. Unless specifically regulated by vertical signage, the maximum authorized parking time will be forty-five minutes, which once completed will prevent parking in high-volume spaces in the same neighborhood until thirty minutes have elapsed from the moment the authorization ended. If the authorized parking time limit is exceeded by less than thirty minutes, the payment for the excess may be supplemented, in which case it will be considered valid parking, thereby avoiding the violation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Differentiated Deterrent Scope (ADD)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>SER spaces located in spaces with low residential or rotational occupancy, preferably in the vicinity of transport interchanges or collective public transport stations, to promote modal exchange, discourage the use of private vehicles and promote the use of regular collective public transport. The spaces are <b>marked horizontally with a dashed line of alternating orange and blue colors</b>. A rate of <b>€0.5 per hour</b> is applied and there is no rotation (you can park continuously during the 12 hours of service with a single ticket payment). Currently there are several <b>Differentiated Deterrent Areas</b>: around <i>Paseo del Rey</i>, in <i>Parque del Oeste</i> and in <i>Cuesta de la Vega</i>.</li>
  </ul>
