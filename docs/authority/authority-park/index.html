  <h1>Authority Park</h1>
  <p>The <b>Authority Park</b> is a suburban neighborhood and a park located in <b>Terrafe</b>.</p>

  <h3 id="history">History</h3>
  <p>The land on which Authority Park sits today has long been occupied by an oak forest typical of the area. The place where it is was never massively inhabited until the 1980s because it was located far from especially fertile rivers and banks. During the first years of the Modern Age, due to the establishment of the Court in Terrafe and the subsequent increase in population in the area, the forests were cut down, thus giving rise to an area of dry crops. This is how the situation lasted until the 1980s.</p>
  <p>At the end of the 1970s, the construction of a neighborhood of single-family homes was planned to accommodate the growing population of the city, as well with the park. In this way, Miror Park began to be executed in 1977, and a year later its creation was definitively approved.</p>

  <h3 id="neighborhood">The Neighborhood</h3>
  <p>Home to post-ironic hipsters, driving Issis and drinking Bean Machine coffee. The area is based on <b>Silver Lake</b> in Los Angeles, known for having a high concentration of hipsters in residence.</p>
  <p>Authority Park is primarily middle-class. The houses are average-sized, and most of them are situated around the park or up in the elevation, while some homes are also under construction. Many of the houses in the area are also being rented out by Wolfs International Realty, probably due to gentrification.</p>

  <h3 id="park">The Park</h3>
  <p>The park is the most characteristic of the area. It also has several bars and shops within it. Inside the park there are benches, various meadows, stepped terraces through which water channels circulate, a pond and a fountain.</p>
  <p>The streets closest to the park (<b>Arcas del Agua St.</b>) have a supermarket and other stores of interest such as grocery stores, hairdressers and tobacconists.</p>
  <p>It has free parking for park visitors that is open from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.</p>
  <p>It occupies an area of 10.45 hectares where pine vegetation predominates. In its central area, there is a sculptural group dedicated to the CEO of <a href="/docs/authority/radio/the-labs-x-fm-001/">The Labs X Radio<a>.</p>
  <p>Water canals, built years before, currently pass beneath Authority Park.</p>

  <h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
  <p>The layout of Authority Park is quite simple. In the centre of the neighborhood- is the park itself. The streets surrounding are all lines with small house, with some similarities with Sector III.</p>
  <p>In the eastern end of Authority Park, there are two <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_end_street">cul-de-sac↗</a> roads; one fully developed with occupied homes, and a second still under development with homes in various states of completion.</p>
  <p> In the south-east end of the neighbourhood, there are a section of streets made up of various different businesses; this serves as an area of commerce.</p>
  <p>There is also a <a href="/docs/authority/fomocoil">FoMoCoil gas station</a> that comes with a convenience store located at the northern edge of the neighbourhood. Also situated in the north is one of two main sources of storm drain. Maintenance workers can be seen operating the machinery of the canal and it's scheduled the works to end at 2026.</p>

  <h3 id="transport">Transport</h3>
  <p>Authority Park has numerous access facilities both from the center and the periphery. Public transportation was a safe bet and has many through lines.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Highways</b>: San Pedro Highway (S-32) and T-40 ring road.</li>
    <li><b>Buses</b>: Urban lines 32, 54, 108 and 112 (which connect with Terrafe centre), and other lines 212, 221 and 226 hat connect with other nearby cities and the night lines N201 and N205, which connect the neighborhood with the centre too.</li>
    <li><b>Train</b>: <i>Authority Park</i> train station of Terrafe Transport, line <b>T-8a</b></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="demography">Demography</h3>
  <p>Has a population of 2,217 inhabitants (TRS 2021), and the majority grouped in families. It's one of the last neighborhoods in Terrafe in terms of number of inhabitants. The population under 25 years of age has a large presence in the total if we compare it with older neighborhoods like Centro. The average per capita income of the neighborhood's citizens is slightly higher than €32,000 annually.</p>

  <h3 id="radio-station">Radio Station</h3>
  <p>Months ago, the neighborhood decided to open a radio station for indie music in Spanish. During the <a href="https://get.cdn.bbjprojek.org/download_private_full?token=DSA0VtSQm71e66ebe5X1Lg5Zp0vcC8IGOxCr">voting period</a> the results were <b>345</b> votes in favor and <b>49</b> against.</p>
  <p>In 2024, the radio was launched under the name <a href="/docs/authority/radio/radio-authority-park/">Radio Authority Park</a>, with transmission taking place in the building in the center of the park.</p>
  <p>The radio is available to listen to 24/7 and has a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/55VHA3LxXpurrUbGThKxVH">Spotify Playlist</a> with weekly updates.</p>
