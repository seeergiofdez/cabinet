  <h1>Lithos Cannals</h1>
  <p>The Lithos Canals are a series of waterways located in the district of Lithos. The Lithos Canals are made up of several residential homes built on small islands surrounded by water. There are also some retail buildings. The neighbourhood is not very large but is affluent.</p>

  <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
  <p>The <b>Lithos Canals</b> are home to many wealthy people who want to live near the beach.</p>
  <p>The houses are not as upscale as those in places such as <a href="/docs/authority/authority-park/">Authority Park</a>, instead they're more focused on the stunning views the area has to offer.</p>
  <p>The canals themselves aren't very deep, so people are able to wade around freely. At both day and night time, the Lithos Canals are relatively peaceful and quiet, aside from the occasional cars driving through.</p>
  <p>Almost every building in the canals is for residential use only. Most of the homes are quiet low-rise apartments or dingbats similar to ones around La Dehesa, with an open-air garage or carport and a large staircase in the back.</p>
  <p>There are two islands sitting inside of the canals. These islands are small strips and contain houses. There are a few narrow roads along the canals; these roads lead out into the rest of Lithos district.</p>

  <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
  <p>In Lithos Canals there are one public preschool and primary school and one secondary education institute.</p>

  <h3 id="transport">Transport</h3>
  <p>Lithos Canals have three streets in its interior, but there are two bus routes that passes through one of them (Prosperity St.).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Highways</b>: Peaceful Freewa (S-31) and T-30 ring road</li>
    <li><b>Buses</b>: Urban lines 32 and 102 that passes through the islands, and nearby lines 41, 45, 48, 63, 66, 102, 118 and 119 lines at Revenue Avenue (three-minute walking). Some lines connect the centre with nearby cities via Ladrera Freeway (S-5). There are lines N501, N503 and N505 that passes through Revenue Avenue, which connect the neighborhood with the centre too.</li>
    <li><b>Metro</b>: The Revenue metro station from Line 2</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="demography">Demography</h3>
  <p>Has a population of 1,230 inhabitants (TRS 2018), and the majority grouped in families.</p>
  <p>In this neighbourhood there are several apartments and building destinated for students and summer.</p>

  <h3 id="parking-problems">Parking Problems</h3>
