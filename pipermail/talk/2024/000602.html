Hey Labs folks!

As always, we're breakin' the mold and servin' up a fresh batch of tunes that defy genres and bend reality.  Think alternative anthems, indie fire, and R&B grooves that'll have you grooving on a whole new level.  Cannons who? We got new heroes ready to blow your speakers (but hopefully not your mind... too much).

We're talkin' 2020s bangers carefully curated to take you on a wild musical journey. It's more than just music, it's a vibe, an eclectic yet cohesive potion designed to blow your mind (in a good way, we promise).

This time around, we're ditchin' the usual radio chatter and spicin' things up with some BBJProjeK magic, unique outros that'll leave you wanting more. (Don't worry, we'll keep the commercials to a minimum, you're welcome!)

Remember, The Labs X FM isn't your average radio station. We're the renegades of the airwaves, born on a train in a security system known for its... well, let's just say "interesting" functionality. (Think European Rail Traffic Management System, ertms, for the trivia buffs out there).

See you on the other side!
Dyne Larsen, The Labs X FM Crew & The BBJProjeK Organization
