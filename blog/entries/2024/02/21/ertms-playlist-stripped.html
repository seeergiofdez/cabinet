  <p>It's been more than a year since I've added the first song to this playlist. This is the most curated and personal playlist I've ever made, and deserves to be stripped and explained, as it contains a detailed organization and timeline</p>
  <h3 id="history">History</h3>
  <p>My passion for alternative and indie pop music began many years ago with groups like <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7FtCyCJCJaxabYO7Uyda5B">Cannons</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3UAk61T8PItbpgEi9u7ofY">Andrew Belle</a>, back in 2021. The fact of not knowing many more groups of this genre made it difficult to create a playlist that brought this genre together</p>
  <p>ertms (stylized in all lower-case) borns in Getafe and plays indie pop/rock and alternative music. Started the playlist with 16 songs including artist like <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4tPyCwWrsvZ8OKYl7QRavL?si=jVCLX_vzRB6x-q8ExHU_9Q">Yumi Zouma</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2NFrAuh8RQdQoS7iYFbckw?si=LOT4l7cxTIq1Y9YlBXjd7g">The Midnight</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2sphpXGg1u97VSzbm5gR2P?si=ksCPYEk1RGOpVazxC3vTRA">JOY.</a>, as well as the previolsy named groups.</p>

  <h3 id="evolution">Evolution</h3>
  <p>On February 2023 I continued my playlist by discovering new similar artists and bands. By the time discovering new artist I was going through some breakdowns and confusing time... Bands like <b>New Constellations</b>, <b>CASTLEBEAT</b> and <b>LEISURE</b> kept me hopeful in these hard months.</p>
  <p>On April 2023 I friend of mine and after a trip to Italy, we shared some indie and alternative bands. Ended up discovering & enjoying <b>Emotional Oranges</b>, <b>RICEWINE</b> and <b>Rosie Darling</b>'s music. At that time, my playlist had grown to include a diverse selection of 50 tracks, each with its own special charm and appeal.</p>
  <p>On October 2023, I got back to my lovely playlist and started to find some songs for it. With artist like <b>Fiji Blue</b>, <b>Christian Kuria</b> and <b>Julia Wolf</b>.</p>

  <h3 id="structure">Playlist Structure</h3>
  <p>The playlist follows a curated sctructure;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A. Good-vibes songs</li>
    <li>B. Neutral songs</li>
    <li>C. Misc</li>
    <li>D. Slow & Sad songs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This structure helps me to choose the mood I want to listen. The A type represents the 25% of the playlist.</p>

  <h4>Bright Lights by Cannons</h4>
  <p>Ryan Clapham and Paul Davis, who have been friends since childhood, began composing music together in their teenage years. In 2013, Clapham and Davis formed Cannons with Michelle Joy after meeting her through the website Craigslist, where she had posted an advertisement seeking a band in need of a vocalist. The trio collaborated on early Cannons material over the Internet, with Clapham and Davis emailing musical tracks to Joy, who would then email back her own lyrical and vocal contributions.</p>
  <p>Shadows, Cannons' second album, was released in 2019 by AntiFragile Music."Fire for You", the first single from Shadows, gained significant commercial traction after being featured in a 2020 episode of the comedy-drama TV series "Never Have I Ever".</p> -->
