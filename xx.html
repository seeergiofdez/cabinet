  <h1>I'm losing my self control</h1>
  <a>Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in</a><br>
  <a>But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole</a><br>
  <a>Cross my heart, I won't do it again</a><br>
  <br>
  <a>I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"</a><br>
  <a>And I do, I do</a><br>
  <a>But once in a while I trip up, and I cross the line</a><br>
  <a>And I think of you</a><br>
  <br>
  <a>Two years, and just like that, my head still takes me back</a><br>
  <a>Thought it was done, but I guess it's never really over</a><br>
  <a>Oh, we were such a mess, but wasn't it the best?</a><br>
  <a>Thought it was done, but I guess it's never really over</a><br>
  <br>
  <a>Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over</a><br>
  <a>And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again</a><br>
  <a>And I'll have to get over you all over again</a><br>
  <br>
  <a>Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over</a><br>
  <a>And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again</a><br>
  <a>And I'll have to get over you all over again</a><br>
  <br>
  <a>I guess I could try hypnotherapy</a><br>
  <a>I gotta rewire this brain</a><br>
  <a>'Cause I can't even go on the internet</a><br>
  <a>Without even checking your name</a><br>
  <br>
  <a>I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"</a><br>
  <a>And I do, I do</a><br>

  <br>
  <a>Thought we kissed goodbye, thought we meant this time</a><br>
  <a>Was the last, but I guess it's never really over</a><br>
  <a>Thought we drew the line right through you and I</a><br>
  <a>Can't keep going back, I guess it's never really over</a><br>
